Haymarket
===========

Haymarket - an organizing database

Background
----------
This project is intended to become a resource for labor unions to keep track of members.  The initial phase
of this will be to keep track of shops, members and dues.  Later incarnations will be used for mapping
shop structures (leaders, followers, etc.) and dealing with edge case scenarios like "Right to Work" laws.

Resources
---------
Currently this project is being developed with the Django Web Framework
